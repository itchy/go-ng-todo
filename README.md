go-ng-todo
==========

Go backend for Angular todo list

This is a go version of the ng-todo Rails app in my repo.
This app uses the same database as ng-todo and lacks all 
support for migrations etc.

This is my first attempt at a go program lots of things
that need to be improved, but basic functionality is working
